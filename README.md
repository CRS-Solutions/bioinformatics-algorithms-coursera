### Repository Structure
---
***Top Level Directory***

The top level directory contains problem solutions.  The problems are organized by the week which they are assigned, and their position on the given weeks assignment.  Specifically, Assignment_XXY denotes week XX, problem Y. 

***Scripts Directory***

The scripts directory contains scripts for various processes which appear in multiple programming problems but are not solutions to actual problems.

***Data and Output Directories***

The data and output directories hold text files containing the data for each problem supplied by Stepic, and the associated output from my solutions.
